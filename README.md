![The extension in-action](https://github.com/himanshumehta1114/vscode-view-npm-docs/blob/master/view-npm-docs.gif?raw=true)


## Motivation

When developing apps, we need to frequently checkout the npm package docs. To do that, we need to see the exact package name in import/require statements and manually search for them `npmjs.com`. To save this effort, this extension lists all the dependencies being used in the current working project. Selecting any dependency from list takes you to its `npmjs.com` page.
